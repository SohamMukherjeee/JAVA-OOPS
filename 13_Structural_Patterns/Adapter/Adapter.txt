The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together. 
It acts as a bridge between an existing class (or system) and the one you need it to work with.


Intent:
To allow classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping one class with 
an adapter that translates the interface.
