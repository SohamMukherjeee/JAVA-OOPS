The Decorator Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to add new behavior to an 
object dynamically without altering its structure or affecting other objects of the same class.

Use When:

You want to add responsibilities to individual objects, not the whole class.

You want to avoid subclassing for every feature combination.

You follow the Open/Closed Principle (open for extension, closed for modification).
