# Thread in java

Thread is the `unit` of execution in java. It is a lightweight process that can run concurrently with other threads. A thread is a separate path of execution in a program, and it can be used to perform tasks in the background while the main thread is running.

## Context switching

When a thread is running, it can be interrupted by the operating system to allow another thread to run. This process is called context switching. Context switching allows multiple threads to share the CPU and run concurrently. The process of storing the state of a process and moving it to another process, after finishing the process,it move back to the original process is called context switching.

## Concurrency

Concurrency is the ability of a program to execute multiple processes or threads simultaneously. It allows a program to perform multiple tasks at the same time, which can improve the performance of the program. Concurrency can be achieved through the use of threads, processes, or a combination of both.

## Parallelism
