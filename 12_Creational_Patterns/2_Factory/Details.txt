The Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating 
objects without specifying their exact class types. It lets the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

Problem it Solves
Without Factory:
Car car = new Sedan(); // Tight coupling
With Factory:
Car car = CarFactory.getCar("SEDAN"); // Loose coupling
