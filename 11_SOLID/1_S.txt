S->Single Responsibility Principle(SRP)

A class should have only one reason to change.
Each class should focus on a single task or responsibility.

importance:
SRP is foundationalâ€”violating it leads to tightly coupled and 
hard-to-maintain code.


// Bad: User class handles both data and persistence
class User {
    String name;
    void saveToDatabase() { /* ... */ }
}

// Good: Separate responsibilities

class User {
    String name;
}

class UserRepository {
    void save(User user) { /* ... */ }
}
