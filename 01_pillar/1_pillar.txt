 1. What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data (fields) and code (methods).

4 Pillars of OOP:
Encapsulation – Wrapping data & code into a single unit.

Abstraction – Hiding internal details, showing only functionality.

Inheritance – Acquiring properties from another class.

Polymorphism – One interface, many forms (method overloading/overriding).
