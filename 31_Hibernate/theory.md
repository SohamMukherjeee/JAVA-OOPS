# Hibernate in Java

Hibernate is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for Java. It provides a way to map Java objects to database tables and vice versa. Hibernate abstracts away the complexities of database interactions and allows developers to work with Java objects instead of SQL queries.

## why it's better than JDBC

1. Object-Oriented Approach: Hibernate allows developers to work with Java objects, which is more intuitive and easier to understand than working with SQL queries and ResultSets in JDBC.

2. IN JDBC you have to follow 5 steps to connect to a database and execute queries. In Hibernate, you can simply define your entity classes and use the Hibernate API to perform CRUD operations without worrying about the underlying database interactions.
